    <div id="bio">
      <h2> Biography</h2>
      <p>
        I have been a chef for the last 17 years and the last 6 I worked at Google running some of their Cafes. It was a
        great and rewarding career, but I'm ready to make the big change to tech.
        I've always been interested in tech, just never made it a part of my career path.
        I grew up in New York, but lived in a bunch of other places before that and then moved to Boston where I met my
        future wife.
        We moved across the country in our old Subaru, piled high with our effects, so that she could go to grad school
        at UW. We settled into living in Fremont and eventually made our way to West Seattle during the pandemic.
        I recently switched into customer support for a tech company so that I can get my foot in the door and break
        into the world of software development.</p>

    <div id="education">
      <h2>Education</h2>
      <p>I went to culinary school at Johnson and Wales University back in Rhode Island where I got an Associates Degree
        in Culinary Arts and a Bachelors of Science in Food Service Entrepreneurship.</p>

      <p>After that I got a certificate in Marketing Management from the University of Washington Foster School of
        Business. There was a big focus on strategic marketing management and marketing strategies.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="career">
      <h2>Career</h2>
      <p>
        My career has been predominantly in Food Service. I worked for Compassgroup USA which services lots of high end
        corporations and educational systems for food service. I worked as a line cook and lead for several law firms
        before moving to Washington and starting at google as the night lead. I dabbled in front of the house and back
        of the house until I took up a Sous Chef role which is really a general manager for a single cafe. I worked as
        the leader of several cafes and ran teams of up to 30. I was our client engagement champion frequently
        discussing customer engagement at public speaking events. During the pandemic I learned a lot about content
        creation, learning & development, and presented this information to hundreds of employees across several states.
      </p>

      <p> After that I left work at a school as an interim job while I worked towards becoming a developer. A few months
        later I got a job as a customer support/it specialist for MarginEdge, a food service tech company. It's
        extremely helpful to have one foot in the door with tech and to get a chance to use things like SQL in my job
        gives me a taste of the dev life.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="goals">
      <h2>Goals</h2>
      <p> My goals are to become a software developer and eventually move into a position of tech leadership. I love
        working for a dynamic company and something that could incorporate food into a developer job would be
        incredible.
