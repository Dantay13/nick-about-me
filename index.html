    <div id="bio">
      I have been a chef for the last 17 years and the last 6 I worked at Google running some of their Cafes. It was a great and rewarding career, but I'm ready to make the big change to tech.
       I've always been interested in tech, just never made it a part of my career path.
        I grew up in New York, but lived in a bunch of other places before that and then moved to Boston where I met my future wife.
         We moved across the country in our old Subaru, piled high with our effects, so that she could go to grad school at UW.
